# dart_data_patterns:

## learning dart data patterns.
This is for using sets of data,
and how to work with JSON in dart 3,
the course is on Google CodeLabs!

## The design here is my own not the codelabs!

#### This is my own design to the file system not part of coarse

##### I spreaded out the code to more pages for my own personal touch and ease of reading previews

###### Added a export file system for better looking code without having 15 imports at the top of each file

###### If you never used it before then this is worth a look but if not just another codelab project for flutter
