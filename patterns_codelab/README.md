## learning dart 3 data patterns

### My own original file structure
the file structure is of my own design for readability,
accessibility, and for my own personal satisfaction, 

### Tired of code being to long and to many imports well in this,
I showed how you could improve the code your currently working with making more pages,
isn't always a bad thing as long as you properly do it.

#### Add a export file system to hold your exports so you no longer have 10 imports at the begging of a file!
I strongly recommend you learn how to do this, and experimint with different amounts of pages so you learn more about the way it saves you time. 
It also helps the future developer who might be brought in on your code from getting a huge headache,
looking at your ten imports on each page condense your code for your future self so you dont get a headache from
all the wasted amount of time you took scrolling past your ten imports at the top of the page...

Ok done with my rant on this. (:LOL:)
If you read this hope you smiled,
and agreed with me on this but if not,
hope when you discover what I'm talking about,
you dont get as annoyed by it as I did lol.
